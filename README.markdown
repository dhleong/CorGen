CorGen
======

CorGen is a project created for my Software Engineering course as part of my Master's Degree
studies at The College of William and Mary. It is a framework whose purpose is to simply the
generation of corpora for various projects, with the primary goal of flexibility and 
extensibility. 

See [http://www.cs.wm.edu/~dhleong/corgen](the project webpage) for more information, including
the final paper written for it.
